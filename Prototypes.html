      <p>In my journey to become a Software Developer, I set out to learn how to make a simple version of a game and a detailed plan for designing games.
        I was excited and determined to explore the world of creating games.

        I started by understanding the importance of a framework called MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) in game design.
        It helped me think about and analyze games in a structured way. Once I had a good grasp of this,
        I moved on to turning my ideas into something tangible.
        
        I used online tutorials and workshops to learn how to make a basic version of a game using paper.
        I learned to draw out the mechanics of the game on paper, creating rough but functional versions of the different parts of the game.
        This process allowed me to test and improve ideas quickly,
        making the mechanics better and finding any issues before spending a lot of time and resources.
        
        At the same time, I worked on creating a detailed plan for the game called a game design document (GDD).
        This plan covered everything about the game, including mechanics, gameplay loops, storylines, and visuals.
        The GDD was like a map for the development team, giving everyone a clear vision and helping us communicate effectively.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">These are 3 GDD’s that I/We made in word files.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The image is just a small example of a paper Prototype. (has nothing to do with the downloads)</p>
