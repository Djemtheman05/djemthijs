      <p>During a game Jam, I teamed up with two talented software students/friends to make a scary horror game using C# and Unity.
        We wanted to try something new, and after considering different genres, we settled on horror. We worked together closely,
        and came up with lots of creative ideas.
        Our goal was to make a game that would give players chills and stick with them even after they stopped playing.
        We used Github to collaborate effectively, sharing our code and assets and keeping track of our progress.
        By combining visuals,mechanics and dynamics  we brought the game to life.
        It was designed to keep players on the edge of their seats, fully immersed in the experience.
        Even after the game jam ended, I couldn't let go of my fascination with our creation. I made a daring decision to continue working on the game
        and fixing some bugs because we only had a small week in the game Jam to make the game.    
        The Idea of the game is that you spawn in a dark room with a flashlight and you need to find different fridges that randomly spawn in the room.
        The catch is that a creature is chasing you down and kills you if you touch it.
        It's vaguely based on people that randomly get hungry late at night and go downstairs to grab some food.
        But also get scared because it's late at night.
        Your objective is to make a sandwich and get the ingredients out of the fridges that you found without getting caught.
        The game is still in progress and I want to add different mechanics such as an effect that an ingredient gives you.</p>
